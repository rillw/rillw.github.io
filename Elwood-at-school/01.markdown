Elwood
------

Here's the news you've all been waiting for. Elwood is a male yellow
Labrador Retriever. He's not a big dog. At the moment he is laying
quietly under the computer desk. He hasn't decided to like me
yet. I'm okay when I bring food. He will be quite affectionate. When
he forgets he doesn't like me, he jumps in my lap and kisses me. Then
he remembers he doesn't like me, gets down and watches the door,
hoping our instructor will come.
