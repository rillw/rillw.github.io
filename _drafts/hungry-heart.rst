Text: Acts 9:1-20

In the name of Jesus. Amen. 

I have noticed that when we read a narrative like this one in the Bible
we accept the storyteller's version without question. 

+ Thunder. 
+ Lightning. 
+ A voice from heaven.
+ Scales falling from Saul's eyes.

These details exist because that is how it happened. A good reporter
gets the story right. 

One of the things I am realizing is taking these accounts at face value,
whether they are factually accurate or not, diminishes them. I overlook
the artistry of the telling of the tale and therefore miss many
subtleties; these subtleties help me understand the story better.

I started going down this road of discovery when I read several
different translations of our text. The New International Reader's
Version, which is a paraphrase, not a direct translation, has Jesus
asking Saul: 

    Why are you opposing me? 

The word *oppose* has a different connotation than *persecute*. I
can be opposed to having lunch at a particular restaurant after church
today. I do not persecute my friends if they disagree with me.
Persecution is unfair. Opposition happens all the time. People disagree.

Therefore, Jesus' question to Saul has no negative connotation. If I
give reasons for my particular opposition to a particular restaurant, my
friends can offer rebuttals. They may convince me to change my mind.

Jesus chooses to convince Saul. Jesus chooses to demonstrate Saul's
ignorance to him by blinding him temporarily.

We say Jesus converted Saul on the road to Damascus. I do not think the
word *road* appears in the original text of the story. A common word
for *road* is *way*. This may tell us something about ancient
highway construction and street repair. The early Christians, as we read
in this narrative, are called *people of the Way*. In this sense, *The Way*
is a way of life, of being, of living, of faith. Paul journeys to
Damascus. Journey also can have the sense of going through life. 

I am belaboring this to suggest to you that it is not surprising Saul
encounters Jesus as he makes his way to Damascus. The point of the
exercise is *The Way*. Saul is not on the right path. He opposes
Jesus. He is persecuting the people of The Way and in so doing, he is
persecuting Jesus. Jesus appears to him verbally. Saul cannot see him
for who Jesus really is. And to underscore this, Saul becomes blind and
must be led into Damascus by the hand. Where does he lodge? A Street
called Straight. Not because the house of Judas just happens to have a
convenient address, but because Saul needs to go straight, be
straightened out.

This is why some scholars think we are well advised to refer to this as
Paul's call rather than his conversion. Paul, in his letters, refers to
himself as a Jew, a Pharisee and a member of the tribe of Benjamin. He
says, for example, in Galatians 3:28: 

    There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, neither male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

Paul is certainly not a Greek so he is a Jew.

Jesus calls Saul to a very different vocation. He is not to oppose
Christians. He is to 

    proclaim my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the people of Israel. (Acts 9:15)

Proclaiming sounds like a pretty good gig. Saul is certainly zealous
enough. He is preaching in the Damascus synagogues within a few days of
his baptism. 

The call has two parts. Proclaim is the first part. Suffer is the second
part.

Saul caused great suffering when he opposed the people of The Way. He
will experience suffering now that he has joined them.

Think of those great passages from Paul's letters to the Corinthians:

    We are fools for Christ. But you are so wise in Christ! We are weak. But you are so strong! You are honored. But we are looked down on! Up to this very hour we are hungry and thirsty. We are dressed in rags. We are being treated badly. We have no homes. We work hard with our own hands. When others call down a curse on us, we bless them. When we are attacked, we put up with it. When others say bad things about us, we answer kindly. Up to this moment we have become the world's garbage. We are everybody's trash. (1 Corinthians 4:10-13)

Or this:

    We speak the truth. We serve in the power of God. We hold the weapons of godliness in the right hand and in the left. We serve God in times of glory and shame. We serve him whether the news about us is bad or good. We are true to our calling. But people treat us as if we were pretenders. We are known, but people treat us as if we were unknown. We are dying, but we continue to live. We are beaten, but we are not killed. We are sad, but we are always full of joy. We are poor, but we make many people rich. We have nothing, but we own everything. (2 Corinthians 6:7-10)

Or this:

    I have suffered terrible beatings. Again and again I almost died. Five times the Jews gave me 39 strokes with a whip. Three times I was beaten with sticks. Once they tried to kill me by throwing stones at me. Three times I was shipwrecked. I spent a night and a day in the open sea.

    I have had to keep on the move. I have been in danger from rivers. I have been in danger from robbers. I have been in danger from people from my own country. I have been in danger from those who aren't Jews. I have been in danger in the city, in the country, and at sea. I have been in danger from people who pretended they were believers.

    I have worked very hard. Often I have gone without sleep. I have been hungry and thirsty. Often I have gone without food. I have been cold and naked. (2 Corinthians 11:23-27) 

And why?

Because Jesus calls Paul to The Way. Paul takes Jesus seriously and
lives accordingly. 

By some accounts, Paul traveled over 3,000 miles, founded many of
churches and wrote many more letters than we still possess. His career
is remarkable. What would he have been like with a fax machine, email
and texting? His Twitter feed would have thousands of followers. Imagine
how many friends he would have on Facebook.

Paul calls himself an apostle, one who is sent. We use the word
evangelist. Evangelism is one of those scary words. I always picture a
lunatic on a street corner with a flyer. 

+ Repent.
+ The Day of Judgment is at hand.
+ The end of the world is almost here.
+ Are you saved?
+ Are you ready to accept Jesus as your Lord and Savior right here on this sidewalk?

Paul did think the end would come soon. It did not. I still read Paul's
letters and follow his adventures because I identify with him. I know 

+ that hole inside which drives me to find something to fill it
+ Stuff from the store doesn't fill it.
+ Alcohol doesn't fill it.
+ Drugs don't fill it.
+ Overeating doesn't fill it.
+ that sense of being out of sorts 

  - with myself, 
  - with my environment, 
  - with the people around me


My list could go on and on.

I know there are many hungry-hearted people beyond these walls. I know
they are inside here, too. Listen to what Paul writes to the Galatians
about himself: 

    You have heard of my earlier way of life as a Jew. With all my strength I attacked the church of God. I tried to destroy it. I was moving ahead in my Jewish way of life. I went beyond many Jews who were my own age. I held firmly to the teachings passed down by my people.
 
    But God set me apart from the time I was born. He showed me his grace by appointing me. He was pleased to show his Son in my life. He wanted me to preach about Jesus among those who aren't Jews. (Galatians 1:13-16a)

Saul hungers to be the best religious practitioner ever. Jesus redirects
his devotion outward, to telling the good news to other hungry-hearted
people. 

When I connect to the wireless network in the Upper Peninsula, I receive
a message: redirecting to pasty.net. I think that is the greatest web
address ever. I will be satisfied it says. I will be filled. The whole
Internet will be available to me

In some of the quotations from Paul's letters I have shared with you
this morning, Paul talks about his own physical hunger and thirst. It is
clear, however, that Jesus satisfies his spiritual hunger. This is what
he wants to share with others. This is the good news. People's spiritual
hunger will be satisfied if they become people of the Way. They do not
have to go off on the road to Damascus with documents to drag men and
women off to prison and death to have a relationship with their God. 

I know physical hunger is a crisis, here in Madison and around the
world. Don't get me wrong about this. We need to address it.

Spiritual hunger is also real and we need to address it. All of us face
it from time to time whether we come to church or we stay home. Saul's
experience of spiritual hunger gives us language to talk about our
experience of spiritual hunger. Paul's witness to how Jesus satisfies
his hungry heart gives us language to talk about our witness to how
Jesus satisfies our hungry hearts. Another way to put this is: Jesus is
the bread of life. 

What we say when we come here, when we share our experience of Jesus
with another person is: this relationship is worthwhile. Paul does not
tramp all those miles, endure all those sufferings, for nothing. He
brings people a way of life which plugged up the hole in their hungry
gut. He tells people where to find the bread that satisfies their
spiritual hunger. 

That is what Saul did not know at first. That is why Jesus, literally or
figuratively, stopped him on the road to Damascus and said, "Hey! There
is more. There is much, much more to life than this. There is
forgiveness and grace and love and good relationships with one another.
I am the one who fills that hole inside you and gives you peace."

Communion is one of the ways we celebrate this filling. Jesus satisfies
the hungry heart of each one of us.  Amen.
