Today is Epiphany: the Magi and the star. I located a sermon I
preached at The Judson Fellowship in 2004. It's both fun and humbling
to reread what I wrote over a decade ago. I called this sermon :doc:`star-of-bethlehem`.

It's sad to think my cookie cutters sit in a box in storage unused. The amount of sugar in my favorite Christmas cookies would definitely do me in. Sadly, too, my friends are in the same situation.
