For December 19 ...

|    O Root of Jesse, standing as a sign among the peoples; 
|    before you kings will shut their mouths, 
|    to you the nations will make their prayer: 
|    Come and deliver us, and delay no longer.

I have noticed that in church circles it is customary to avoid
thinking about Jesus as powerful. We like to stress Jesus as kind and
gentle.

But if we look at today's Great O
Antiphon and compare it to the two previous ones, :doc:`o-wisdom-2014`
and :doc:`o-adonai-2014`, power is written all over them:

* mouth of God
* ordering all creation
* teaching
* lord (adonai)
* leader of Israel
* lawgiver
* deliver

There is lots in the world that is wrong and out of sorts. We cry out
for someone, anyone, to come and fix it. Groups that promise to fix
what is wrong in the world have traction. We may call them crazy or
terrorists, but the reason people give credence to them is this
overwhelming desire for the world to be put right.

King David was Jesse's son, hence the reference to Jesse. In the
ancient Isaraelite imagination, David represents the golden age, the
perfect king. (He wasn't, but that is neither here nor there.) To call
on Jesus as the root of Jesse (Jesus is called son of David and
therefore son or root of Jesse) is to recall a golden age when the
powerful did what was right and good.

Our longing is intensified by the words "without delay". Our need is
great and only Jesus can make the world right again.
