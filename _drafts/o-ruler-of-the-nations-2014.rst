For December 22 ...

|    O King of the nations, and their desire, 
|    the cornerstone making both one: 
|    Come and save the human race, 
|    which you fashioned from clay. 

One of the great claims of the new Testament is that it is not about
us and them. It's not about the good guys and everybody else. Jesus is
the ruler of all people, the nations.

Finally the Great O Antiphons express our great desire: to be saved.

"Are you saved?" is one of those questions that has always made me
uncomfortable. It suggests that there is a state of being saved and a
state of not being saved. Again, some are in and some are out.
Absurdly, a human being decides, either you or me.

I am persuaded by 2 Peter 3:9 "The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise,
as some understand slowness. Instead he is patient with you, not
wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance."

So I heartily give voice to today's antiphon: Come and save the human race."
