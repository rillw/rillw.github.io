ï»¿I write in the name of Jesus. Amen.

Text: 1 Peter 1-2

Focus: Beloved, I beg you as sojourners and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul, having your conduct honorable among the Gentiles, that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by your good works which they observe, glorify God in the day of visitation. (NKVJ)

When I think of pilgrims, I think of the pair of candles my mother put out every Thanksgiving: a man and woman with funny hats. I have to go beyond the *Mayflower*, Plymith Rock and the first Thanksgiving to consider the broader ramifications of the word *pilgrim*.

* *Pilgrim's Progress* a book I've never read;
* the people involved in the Canterbury Tales;

I think more about pilgrimage than being a pilgrim. I have the disparate images of  crusadrs and the faithful making their way to Mecca.

All in all, it's a rather disjointed collection of references. As a result, I was startled to hear the author of 1 Peter address his readers as pilgrims. What does this mean?

In the New Testament, the word *pilgrim* only appears three times:

* 1 Peter 1:1
* 1 Peter 2:11
* Hebrews 11:13

And it is only the King James and New King James versions that use it. Nevertheless, this word has been the key for my understanding of these first chapters of 1 Peter.

We are a comfortable lot, that is, we accept the world for what it is: good and bad. I'm making some assumptions here, primarily that my readers have the time, skill and means to find this web site and read it. I'm not imagining a person with a limited data plan on a low-end smart phone spending time here. That's sad in a way but it does suggest to me that I am speaking to a more priviledged group of readers. (Know your audience.) Therefore, I think it is safe to say we are not holding on by the skin of our teeth hoping that Jesus will return in the next twenty-four hours. And, precluding that happy day, we will find ourselves in Paradise after our death. By these standards, we're quite content to stick around as long as we can.

But our home is *that heavenly country* (Hebrews 11:16) and Paul tells us we are *citizens of heaven* (Philippians 3:20).

Oh, very well, you say, we all know this. By and by we'll all get to heaven. What's the big deal? You're not going to go all preachy on us and start talking about abstaining from our lusts, are you? Because if you are, I'm out of here.

Hardly. My point is to propose a change a wayof  thinking about our time on earth, not to harrang anybody about how they live. That's up to them and God, not me

When I started to think about being a pilgrim, I developed a list of definitions which all speak to this change of thinking about earthly life.

* I am a visitor.
* I come from abroad, from somewhere else.
* I am not a citizen of this place.
* I don't have all the rights and priviledges of someone who comes from here.
* I am likely to move on.
* My home here is temporary.
* I am a stranger.
* I am a sojourner.
* I am a foreigner.
* I am an exile.
* I am a resident alien.
* I am migratory.

In the Hebrew Scriptures, both Exodus (22:21) and Deuteronomy (10:19) say the people of Isreal should love and not mistreat the stranger because they had been in the same position before they possessed the land. 

I moved five times in five years at one point in my life. I did not move every year. Some years I stayed put. Other years I moved more than once. I remember whining to someone that I could not put an address on my checks. I was always just passing through.

It has taken me a long time to get comfortable with the idea I am staying where I currently live. I no longer think about what comes next. There's a vague plan about when I can no longer live independently, but that is very nebulous indeed.

The bad thing about going through that unsettled part of my life was that I never could pull all the goodness out of it. Settled people tried to point out the good things about it. Unfortunately, I always thought they could do this because they were settled. When I'm comfortable, I can see posssibilities. When I'm stressed, I can only think of what I don't have. Security and purpose is very important to me.

1 Peter 1-2 forces me to rethink my situation.
I am enriched by the people I know in my current congregation. My life will go on without them. That sense of urgency is gone. I am far more attached to my local senior center. I think it is the local context and daily contact which makes this happen.

1 Peter addresses this book to *pilgrims of the Dispersion* or *Diaspora*. To the Jews of this period, the Dispersion was any place outside of Palestine. 1 Peter names Roman provinces in what is now Turkey. These places would be classified as part of the Diaspora. They, like Palestine, are the Disapora from the heavenly perspective. I don't think 1 Peter's use of the word Diaspora has anything to do with Jews living outside of their homeland. It is using a familiar concept to make a point for those reading or listening to him.

We don't become citizens of  God's heavenly country by birth, but through salvation., that is, the work of Jesus and our hope in God's word.

* God wanted us.
* God got us.
* Now we belong to God.

the communities of believers are uNder threat. From time to time there are Persecusions and some believers are put to death. As a result, it is important to fervently love one another and keep your  head down by conducting yourself so as not to draw attention to yourself.

If I were preaching this text to a congregation, I would focus on the need for the congregation to connect with each other in significant ways. I think that's the message of these first chapters to a 21st-century CONGREGATION.

For a more general audience and for myself, I think the message is different. It's about perception.

* Focus on thorelationships that strengthen you.
* Know that your security rests on God and not on yourself.
* Remember, your homeland is God's country.

Amen.
