Today's flash sermon concerns the image of the flood in 1 Peter 3:18-12. Here's a teaser:

Today I'd like to focus on engaging a text. As disciples, we have the gift of the inspired writings of the entire Bible. I believe it is our responsibility to engage these texts to

- breathe life into our faith
- provide direction for our lives
- bring us closer to God
- challenge and comfort us
