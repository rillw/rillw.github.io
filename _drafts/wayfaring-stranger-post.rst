Here is my first flash sermon.

What is a flash sermon?
-----------------------

Flash fiction means a story that is very short, typically 1000 words or less. This piece is a hundred or so words longer. It's intended to be a short sermon. I am still working on the style and purpose.

Right now I am studying 1 Peter so the sermon focuses on the week's study chapters.

I'll post a teaser here and link to the full piece in the `articles` index. May it prove to be a blessing to you.

When I think of pilgrims, I think of the pair of candles my mother put out every Thanksgiving: a man and woman with funny hats. I have to go beyond the *Mayflower*, Plymith Rock and the first Thanksgiving to consider the broader ramifications of the word *pilgrim*.

* *Pilgrim's Progress* a book I've never read;
* the people involved in the Canterbury Tales;

I think more about pilgrimage than being a pilgrim. I have the disparate images of  crusadrs and the faithful making their way to Mecca.

All in all, it's a rather disjointed collection of references. As a result, I was startled to hear the author of 1 Peter address his readers as pilgrims. What does this mean?
