To refresh your memory, friends bring a paralyzed man to Jesus. Jesus
heals the man and he gets up, picks up his mat and goes home.

Except for being paralyzed and having a few exceptional friends, we
know nothing about this man. He has no speaking part. He appears as he
is lowered down on his mat in front of Jesus. He is last seen walking
away home carrying his mat.

Given this lack of detail, we might be surprised when Jesus says to
him, "Your sins are forgiven." What sins? What did he do?

In ancient times, people assumed a disability meant wrongdoing. Before
you express your outrage at this, notice how often we fall into the
same behavior. Think of the questions we immediately ask, "Was she
wearing a helmet? Did he wear his reflective gear when he went
running?"

Jesus isn't interested in the man's back story or even what his sins
are. He pronounces his sins forgiven. After dealing with the scribes'
unspoken objections, he says to the man, "Rise, take up your mat and
go home."

By physically healing the man, Jesus  enables the man to live his life
in a new way. This is what receiving God's grace does for us, too. We
are free to go forward regardless of our back stories.
