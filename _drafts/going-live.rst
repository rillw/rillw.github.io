Now that I have a little content put together, I can publish `La Jefa`_. There is still a lot of work to do: I have lots of content that needs to be formatted for site release. My plan is to publish a couple of items a week so please check back regularly.

Today I have published:

* :doc:`afternoon-walk`
* :doc:`big-mean-machine`
* :doc:`elwood-at-school`
* :doc:`rills-warning-label`
* :doc:`the-secret-of-playing-cribbage`
* :doc:`transfiguration-a-poem`

This release is heavy on poetry. The files are small. As I progress, I will publish longer pieces.
