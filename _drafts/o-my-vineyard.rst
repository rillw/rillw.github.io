O MY VINEYARD
-------------

| O my vineyard,
| it breaks me wide open to look at you.
| 
| O my vineyard,
| would that I could envelop you in my womb once more,
| would that I could draw you into my heart once more,
| would that I could embrace you in my arms once more.
| 
| O my vineyard,
| I sent my sons and daughters to tend you:
| to plant your roots in good soil,
| to train your vines to grow straight and tall,
| to cover you against storm and cold,
| to bind up your broken branches,
| to protect you from your enemies,
| to pluck your succulent fruit in its season.
|
| Those stiff-necked ones
| who glory in their own wealth,
| who pride themselves on their learning,
| who covet the possessions of others,
| who are self-satisfied with their own accomplishments,
| their own success, their own well-being
| and forget to tend you, my beautiful vineyard.
| 
| O my vineyard,
| Who shall I send to tend you now?
| Who will restore your branches,
| grafting new stock to your withered vines?
| Who will train your vines to grow straight and tall again?
| Who will stand watch over you to keep you from all harm?
| Whose mouth will delight in the taste of your fruit once more?
| 
| I myself will come, my vineyard.
| I will send my beloved Child to tend you.
| My beloved Child:
| the Incarnate One, the Crucified One, the Risen One,
| will be an example to my sons and daughters.
| My Spirit will be upon them
| and they will delight in you once more, my vineyard,
| just as I delight in you.
