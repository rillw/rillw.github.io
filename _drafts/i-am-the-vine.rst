Today I was reading one of my favorite biblical texts, John 15:1-15,
"I am the vine." I went looking on various hard drives for something I
had written, but my drives are still a mess and I couldn't find what I
was looking for. Instead, I found a paper I wrote as part of my
pastoral internship at a continuing care retirement community in
Cupertino, California. You can read the paper here: :doc:`a-theology-of-aging`.
