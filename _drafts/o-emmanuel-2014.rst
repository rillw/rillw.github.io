For December 23 ...

|    O Emmanuel, our king and our lawgiver, 
|    the hope of the nations and their Saviour: 
|    Come and save us, O Lord our God. 

Today we consider our final antiphon. With December 24, the focus is
on celebrating Christmas. The wait is over.

In a sense, this is the great reveal. We have been using other good
and well-deserved titles, but Emmanuel is the fully realized one: God
with us. This is who Jesus is.

Jesus is our true and only hope, the one who is our God, our Savior
and most of all, with us now and forever.

Our final longing is for the saving to begin, for safety to be ours
forever and ever.
