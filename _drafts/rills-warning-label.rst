I wrote this poem in response to Rochelle Melander's `writing
prompt <http://www.writenowcoach.com/blog/?p=842>`__ on her blog.

Rill's Warning Label
--------------------

| Beware: talented writer on duty inside this apartment. 
| Words may saturate your feet when you step inside.
 | Images of fictional characters may cloud your objective vision.
| You may experience an elevated heart rate when heroines encounter villains.
| Risk of cutting flesh from writer revising.``
