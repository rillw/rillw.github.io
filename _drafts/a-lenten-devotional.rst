I was reading through my facebook news feed today and saw a post
inviting people to purchase a Lenten devotional. Ah yes. Lent. It's
coming.

Now that I am a Baptist, I am moving farther and farther away from
liturgical practices, but, as always, I know I drift away from being
grounded in God and the Way of Jesus. Lent is a good time to refocus.

I went to the page. The devotionals are paperback booklets and only
available for sale and in packets of 20 copies. No dice. I'm not doing
that. Besides, the sample pages were not accessible using my free
software. Perhaps they're not accessible using non-free software.

All of this made me angry.

I get why people charge. It costs money to produce a booklet like
this. But it definitely is not for me.

So I'm thinking about Lent and how I can recharge my spiritual batteries.
