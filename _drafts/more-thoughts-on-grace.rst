More thoughts on grace...

Occasionally we experience grace and it is a life-changing experience.
John Newton described this when he penned the second verse of Amazing
Grace: "T'was Grace that taught... my heart to fear. And Grace, my
fears relieved. How precious did that Grace appear... the hour I first
believed." More often, God's grace is more low key.

I attend the Middleton Senior Citizen Center four times a week where I
eat lunch provided by the Dane County Senior Nutrition Program.
Unsurprisingly, people sit in the same seats at the same tables every
day. So do I. I eat lunch with a woman who has short term memory loss.

When I sat down at the table Monday, she said to me, "Shall I get
coffee for you?" She rarely asks this and I rarely ask her for help. I
said "Yes, please," because I can't distinguish the decaf coffee from
the regular and I'm not good about carrying hot liquids any distance
while weaving through the dining area tables.

When she set the coffee in front of me I thought, "Here is God's grace
in action." She received the gift of assisting someone else and I
received not only the gift of coffee, but the gift of seeing the woman
she once was. I'm willing to bet she has served a lot of people in her
life and she still by the grace of God, does.

Your turn. Have you experienced God's grace this week?
