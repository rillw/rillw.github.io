Hello and welcome to La Jefa.

I thought I would write a few introductory lines to kick this blog off.

"Hello World" is often the first program anyone writes or the first test
anyone does. It's basically a throwaway effort. I've used it as this
blog entry's title for fun and to say "Hello" and "Welcome" to anyone
stopping by.

To answer a few questions you may not have asked:

1. Why are there no pictures or graphics here? Every guide you read these days online says to have graphics. That's probably a good idea, but I'm blind and they do nothing at all for me so you're stuck. There will rarely be a circumstance when I post anything graphical.

2. What does *La Jefa* mean? it's *The Boss* in Spanish.

3. Why did you choose that name? It sounded cool and I'm in charge here.

4. Why did you create this site? I wanted a place to share my writing.

5. Again, so why are there no share buttons? Choose your answer wisely:

   1. I'm not creating a platform.
   2. I've never liked popularity contests.
   3. I've never been popular so why start now.
   4. I find all the social buttons distracting on a site.
   5. I want to put content first and liking second.
   6. If you really like something, you'll find a way to tell other people about it.
   7. I want to focus on creating content rather than promoting it.
