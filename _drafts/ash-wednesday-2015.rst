It hasn't worked out for me to work on a lenten devotional this year. Instead I plan to read Scripture. I am using the two-year daily lectionary of the
Presbyterian Book of
Common Worship (Westminster John Knox Press 1993).

My intention is to read it daily through Easter. My goal is to post
here frequently.

I have often used the line from Psalm 51 "Create in me a clean heart"
to summarize my Lenten meditation. This year, however, I found this
verse from Psalm 5 helpful:

   |  Lord, in the morning you shall hear my voice.
   |  In the morning I will lay my requests before you, and will watch expectantly. (v. 3)

I am impressed by the promise to speak to God every day and to be
expectant every day to perceive       God's activity in the world.

If this can be my Lenten discipline, I believe it will change my life
for the better and enhance my relationship with God.

So I've put it out here. Let's see what happens.
