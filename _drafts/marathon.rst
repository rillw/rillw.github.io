In 1908, the Olympic marathon in London was extended by 1.2 miles to
accommodate the royal family. It began on the lawn of Windsor Castle so
that Princess Mary and her children could see the start of the race from
the nursery window. The course was extended further to Queen Alexandra's
royal box so that she could watch the conclusion of the race. `London

Marathon, 1908
-------------

| I run.
|  Princess Mary and her five children watch from the castle nursery
window.
|  "Good-bye, runner, good-bye."
|  "Run fast."
|  "Run far."
|  I run.
|  Feet fly.
|  Steady breaths.
|  Stay alert.
|  Run fast.
|  Run far.
|  The course is long.
|  Feet fly.
|  Steady breaths.
|  Stay alert.
|  Run fast.
|  Run far.
|  The course is long.
|  Twenty-five miles.
|  "God save the queen!"
|  I shout when the race should be done.
|  Another 1.2 miles to go.
|  Haughty queen.
|  So fatigued.
|  Feet no longer fly.
|  Uneven breaths.
|  Disorientation.
|  The royal box: where is it?
|  A pretty picture for your daughter-in-law and grandchildren.
|  A pretty picture for you at the finish line.
|  I stagger.
|  I fall.
|  I die.
|  "Good-bye, runner, good-bye."
|  Tell this to the children in the nursery.
