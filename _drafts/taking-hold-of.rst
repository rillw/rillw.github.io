I have always been puzzled by the verse

  The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness hasn't
  [1>]overcome[<1] it.

  -- John 1:5 (WEB)

The `World English Bible <http://ebible.org/web/>`_ has more to say about the word *overcome*.


  [1] {1:5} The word translated "overcome" (katelaben) can also be
  translated "comprehended." It refers to getting a grip on an enemy
  to defeat him.

It took me a little more research to understand the connection between
physical combat and comprehension. *katalambanw*, "I take hold of",
refers to either a thing or an idea. in the footnote, the key word is
*grip*.

Darkness, then, all the forces of sin, death and the devil, could not
take hold of Jesus physically or get its mind to grasp the idea of
Jesus. This is the point of the resurrection. Death could not hold
onto Jesus.

Tucked away in this Christmas reading is Easter, too.

In a long discussion after the meal and before he is arrested, Jesus
says:

  I have told you these
  things, that in me you may have peace. In the world you have
  oppression; but cheer up! I have overcome the world.

    -- John 16:33 (WEB)

  The world can be a very nasty place. Jesus says we can live in the
  nasty world in a different way.


The reason this can be frought with danger for the 21st century
Christian is that it creates a dichotomy between me and the world,
between Christians and everyone else and, potentially, between me and
you. It's an us and them mentality.

All indications are it was an us and them situation when the Gospel of
John was composed. It doesn't have to continue this way. We can
embrace the good wherever we find it and resist the bad when it comes calling.
