Text: Matthew 2:1-12

Date: January 9, 2004

In the name of Jesus. Amen.

Every December I sort through my cookie cutters and search for new ones that can expand my collection. This year I found a large star.
It's a little tricky to use because the cookie itself must stay
together while being transferred from pastry board to cookie sheet.
I looked through my existing collection of stars. It was time to
cull. I kept the six-pointed star, my mother's star with the wooden
handle and fluted edges, one medium-sized star and a very tiny one.
I also noticed that the Christmas tree cutter with the star on top
had lost its shape and was no longer serviceable.

The star of Bethlehem is the source of these cutters being associated with
Jesus' birth and the wise ones' subsequent visit. Yet it is difficult to
corroborate most gospel events with outside sources. We know, for example,
that Herod the Great--the Herod of this text--died in 4 B. C. E. We can
date certain uprisings. We know the details of a number of reprisals.
Jesus' birth and the subsequent visit of the wise ones, however, remain
undocumented.

Scientists and scholars have searched diligently for evidence of the star.
Some have suggested it was Halley's Comet which appeared in 12 or 11 B. C.
E. Johannes Kepler suggested, in the seventeenth century, the triple
conjunction of Jupiter, Saturn and Mars between 7-6 B. C. E. . Mention is
made in records of the Han-Dynasty in China of an astronomical phenomenon
in 5 B. C. E. From the notice, we can't tell if they saw a supernova or a
comet in their eastern skies. Others have searched fruitlessly for a
supernova that would have been scene upon a midnight clear. Of all these
celestial events, only comets move.

Failing scientific evidence, storytellers have searched for meanings for
the star. Arthur C. Clarke wrote a short story about a race of aliens whom
God chose to sacrifice their sun so its supernova would be seen on earth
at Jesus' birth. The aliens were honored to be selected. The "Littlest
Angel" gave God his treasure box which contained, as I recall, among other
things, a piece of string and a dead frog to honor the Christ child. Being
the most treasured gift God received from the heavenly host, god turned
the box into the star of Bethlehem.

We, too, have expanded the description of the magi with song and pageant
to imagine they are three kings with specific names, camels and kingdoms.

Despite all these scientific and historical dead-ends, our biblical story
draws on historical truth. Magi were the religious priests and scientists
of Persia. They educated the royal children and administered parts of the
empire. As such their designation of king is accurate. Like other eastern
rulers, they would have been seeking opportunities to throw off Roman
domination and to be free of Caesar.

Herod's paranoia and cruelty is well-documented. Herod would be jealous of
any threat to his kingship and therefore to his power. He would deal with
even the suggestion of a threat with cruel force. Lying to visitors with
information about a claim to his throne would be in keeping with Herod's
character and mode of operation.

So one of the things going on in this story is legitimate and illegitimate
authority. Herod's authority comes from Caesar, the hated oppressor. Herod
adopts the titles "Admirer of the Romans" and "Admirer of Caesar." As we
read through the Gospel According to Matthew this year, Jesus' authority
will be questioned by the scribes and the Pharisees, the high priest and
Pontius Pilate--those in authority. Jesus' teachings and miracles will
demonstrate to us his authority from God. God's authority has been given
to Baby Jesus. It does not rest with powerful Herod. God's authority rests
with the king whose birth is portended with a heavenly sign, not with King
HEROD whose kingship comes from Caesar in Rome. It's Caesar against God.
Herod chooses Caesar. The magi choose God's royal child.

Where are we in all of this? The religious/political climate in which we
live is very different from that of the ancient world. Heavenly portents,
mysterious travelers and even a villain like Herod make for good reading,
but they are not the stuff of our newscasts. How can we appropriate
the religious experience of first century Christians and make it our own
here in the twenty-first century?

Searching the Scriptures, we learn that, while the Israelites were still
wandering in the wilderness, Balaam prophesied: "a star shall come out of
Jacob, and a scepter shall rise out of Israel" (Numbers 24:17b). So we,
reading this story today, are put on notice that we aren't keeping an eye
out for a celestial star. We are looking for a religious/political figure.

Although not named, Jesus is the star of this story. Jesus is the star
Balaam spoke of, our true sovereign.

As a child, I was fascinated by the Revolutionary War--not the battles,
but the personalities, the speeches, the ideals: Patrick Henry, "Give me
liberty or give me death!"; Nathan Hale, "I regret I have but one life to
lose for my country." My mother read me a series of books about patriotic
girls who helped in the war effort. They had "Little Maid," in the title
followed by the name of a town. I lived on the road Washington used to
march from the Battle of Trenton to the Battle of Princeton. The farm
nearby was named Washington Well Farm because it was said that the men and
horses drank the well dry that day. Witherspoon, Stockton and Heart were
streets in local towns named for the signers of the Declaration of
Independence who lived there.

"Patriot" is a word that still thrills me and it doesn't mean a player on
a Boston football team. Sadly, the word "patriot" has come to mean loyalty
to a particular set of governmental policies and not to a set of ideals.
Although they are foreigners, Herod gives the Magi the opportunity to
demonstrate their patriotism to the Empire, to tell him, Caesar's
appointee in Palestine, where the threat to his power is located. It's a
question of homeland security.

We all know the joke about the wise men: If they had been women, they
would not have gotten lost; they would have asked for directions. They
would have brought practical gifts like casseroles and diapers instead of
gold, frankincense and myrrh. They would have cleaned the house instead of
just paying homage.

It's always bothered me that the magi tip Herod off and when they don't
return with intelligence on his rival, Herod slaughters the innocent
Bethlehem children. The Magi go home by another road and are spared the
horror and grief.

Even though I am still bothered and someday I want to write about their
response to these events, their work is done. They followed the star
wherever it went until they came to Jesus. Like the shepherds in the
spiritual, they left everything to seek Jesus out. They did this publicly
at great expense and with great hardship.

That's why their arrival is called Epiphany. Their actions make Jesus
known. Epiphany is part of Jesus' debut.

When we have an epiphany, something becomes clear to us. It is a moment of
clarity. From that point on, nothing is the same ever again. Life changes.
In the church season of Epiphany, life changes for Jesus. He begins his
ministry. Life changes for other people, too. Peter and Andrew, James and
John, Philip and Nathanael all come to know and to follow Jesus as his
disciples. The Magi are the prototype for Jesus' followers. They are
foreigners. They share their treasures.

The story of the Magi is told so that Someday, everyone on earth will know
Jesus and, setting other loyalties aside, will come to worship the Star of
Bethlehem, the Perfect Light. Amen.
