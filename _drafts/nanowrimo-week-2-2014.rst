Today is the midpoint of `Nanowrimo <http://nanowrimo.org/>`_. By the end of the day, to be on
track, I should have twenty-five thousand words. I will not. However,
I have moved the story on and discovered new things. 

I like it that I
tell myself a story during nanowrimo and the story tells me many new
and wonderful things, too. 

The two most interesting things to come out
of the writing so far are:

1. The villain of the piece thus far turned out to be Suri Iglesia and
   not Heracles Beja. This may change over time--in fact, I am getting
   a hint that it will.

2. The Tigerfu have revealed themselves.

3. The ancient races have shown up in the murals on the walls of the
   stone structures. Who knew.

I am trying to figure out the 50% mark. There should be a
sense that things have turned bad. OK, I already have Captain Star
runner and Detective Ronnie Camberwell at odds. They are stuck behind
enemy lines. Ronnie just wants to get home and get on with her life
such as it is. Captain Star Runner wants to keep making money. They
are united in their desire too leave but not as a couple.

What am I going to do for the next 28 thousand words? I guess I will
just have to write them and find out.

You can keep up with my very messy first draft of this year's novel at `Behind Enemy
Lines <../behind-enemy-lines.html>`_.
