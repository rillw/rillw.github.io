I make an effort to try to read at least one psalm a day. Professor
Robinson said it would change my life. Today's reading is Psalm 121.
It is one of my favorites.

I am usually touched that God pays attention to me as an individual.
(I also believe God pays attention to you as an individual, too.) I
figure I mostly go through life with no one much caring what happens
to me. I know this is an exaggeration, but gosh, it so often feels
that this is true. Then I come to find out, yet again, that the ruler
of the universe is watching over me. Now how marvelous is that? It is
something I obviously need to be reminded about all the time.
