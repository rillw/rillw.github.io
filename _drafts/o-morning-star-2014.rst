For December 21 ...

|    O Morning Star,
|    splendour of light eternal and sun of righteousness:
|    Come and enlighten those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death.

I am used to reading this as "O Dayspring,' but it literally means "O
Rising Sun".

|    But to you who fear my name
|    the sun of righteousness shall arise
|    with healing in his wings;
|    and you shall go out and grow fat like   stall-fed calves. (Malachi 4.2).

|    Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
|    Hail the sun of righteousness!
|    Light and life to all he brings,
|    Risen with healing in his wings.
|    `Hark! The Herald Angels Sing <http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/hark_the_herald_angels-sands.htm>`_

It is interesting to note that I write this several hours before the
winter solstice in the northern hemisphere. Darkness may be associated
with despair and hopelessness.

I think of Jesus as the light of the world (John 8:12). I am less
likely to think of Jesus as a morning star or rising sun.

The longing in today's Great O Antiphon is for enlightenment. I don't
think this has anything to do with knowledge, at least not directly.
It is for those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death. I think
this suggests direction rather than abstract knowledge.

Malachi points us to the reverence of God, healing and care. We long
for Jesus' presence and the guidance and comfort that presence brings
This light brings hope to anyone who despairs.
