| My sister drove past our house,
| a small house on the county road.
| We've been gone for thirty years.
| Boarded up windows.
| Plants growing up through cracks in the driveway.
| The flag pole, all rusty, standing in the front yard.
| The swing set our neighbor built in the back yard.
| No FOR SALE sign to invite another family in
| where we played and grew up.
| How long before it is torn down?
| The house reminds me of our mother living in memory care.
