`nanowrimo <http://nanowrimo.org>`_ asked me these three questions. I
thought it might be fun to answer them here.

1. What are you most proud of achieving this month?

   For the first time, I was able to go a little deeper with a
   character. Ronnie (and therefore I) considered Ronnie's issues
   around trust and her decisions based on what she (I) learned.
   
2. What did you learn about yourself as a writer?
   
   I learned two things:

   1. I could go deeper with a character. Thus far, all my Nanowrimo
      novels have been very light. Now I know I have the potential to
      make them into something more.
   2. I could continue to write despite

      * not having a clear idea where the story was going. My notes
	show that.

      * inconsistencies with the story. I just kept pushing forward,
	trusting the process to get me somewhere. A rewrite is the
	place to   address these inconsistencies and missteps.


3. What excites you about this draft of your NaNo-novel?

   I have opened narrative possibilities. 

   * Captain Star Runner and    Detective Ronnie Camberwell have an
     opportunity to explore their    relationship in the light of
     Tigerfu mores and without the    ever-present Christabel. 
   * Ronnie's narrative arc can be learning more about the Tigerfu and
     going deeper into the conflict between them and the rest of the
     galactic arm.
   * Star Runner's story arc can separate from Ronnie's. Star can go
     to the Fungusians, back to the Northern Frontier or become a
     Tigerfu agent. This is fraught with peril as it may be necessary
     to reinstitute Christabel and for Star to trust both the
     Fungusians and the Tigerfu not to betray it to the older races.

   Working on this novel has made me more determined to work on preparing all my previous work for web publication.
