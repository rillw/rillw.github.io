Text: 1 Peter 3-4
Focus:1 Peter 3:18-22

In the name of Jesus. Amen.

Today I'd like to focus on engaging a text. As disciples, we have the gift of the inspired writings of the entire Bible. I believe it is our responsibility to engage these texts to

- breathe life into our faith
- provide direction for our lives
- bring us closer to God
- challenge and comfort us

2 Timothy 3:16-17 says 

    All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. (NKJV)  


I've always had trouble with the word *all* in this passage. I've reconciled myself to it by seeing the word *inspired* and knowing that not all the writing in the biblical text has the breath of God in it. As I have said to people in the past,

    The Holy Spirit doesn't live inside your Bible when it's on the shelf. You have to take it down and open it before that happens.

Looking at 1 Peter again this week, I'm faced with another question of interpretation. It is the word *antitype* in verse 21. 

If `John Dominic Crossan <http://johndominiccrossan.com/>`_  is right The early Christians searched the Septuagent (The Hebrew Scriptures in Greek) to make sense of their experiences with Jesus. They tended to read these texts as prefiguring or foreshadowing Jesus' words and deeds of power. They called these references *types*. Jesus' words and deeds are then *antitypes*. The word *anti* here does not mean *against*. It's more about juxtaposition. 

So we have Noah and his family saved from the flood by entering the ark. Modern people might be inclined to focus on the use of myth in pre-literate societies. The early Christians (and some modern ones, too) focused on the saving of Noah and everyone with him from drowning as a way to talk about Baptism, eliminating any discussion of the flood narrative in ancient cultures. `Gilgamesh <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_flood_mth>`_  has no place in such a discussion. Noah et al only exists to point to the ordinance of Baptism.

I found the article `Biblical Typology <http://www.theopedia.com/Biblical_typology>`_ helpful in sorting all this out. I was happy to read that Gerhard von Rad suggests that instead of types and antitypes, we think of anaolgies instead.

Noah and company are facing a catastrophe: the annihilation of every living thing on the earth. God intervenes to show Noah how he will save his family (and the animals, too, though 1 Peter does not mention them.) Noah is to build the ark. 1 Peter calls this *saving through water*.

1 Peter says Baptism is like this--as noah was saved through water in the ark, so the Christian is saved through the water of Baptism. If the *Didache* is representative, the Christian is baptized in cold running water which is a flood of sorts.  

In her article `What Power Does Christ Really Have? Lectionary Blog on 1 Peter 3:18-22 <http://www.politicaltheology.com/bog/what-power-does-christ-really-have-lectionary-blog-on-1-peter-318-22>`_, Amy Allen points out that both the flood and Baptism are violent actions.She says God retook control through the flood in the same way Jesus reworks our lives through Baptism.

I prefer to think of Baptism as a movement into freedom in the same way the children of Israel went through the waters of the Red Sea into freedom, fbut 1 Peter observes in 4:4 
    they [former companions] think it strange that you do not run with them in the same flood of dissipation.

1 Peter imagines Christians are living in a Noah-like time. Most will be swept away by God's judgment. The Christian has a living hope in God that he or she will go to his/her true home in heaven.

For me, much of this kind of thinking does not relate to my Christian experience. That is why this week's flash sermon looks more like a report than a sermon. I'm still having difficulty finding the sense of these chapters that will lead to proclamation. One difficulty is that I am not preparing this text to be preached to a congregation. I don't have a particular setting in mind. Preaching to the Internet is rather nebulous.

I also set out to solve a problem this week: What is an *antitype*. I've figured that out but it did not lead me anywhere, at least not to a sermon.

Noah's crew was not transformed by their experience. They simply survived it because God gave them enough warning for them to build the ark. Christians, on the other hand, are not expected to just survive after Baptism. Life is to begin afresh much as God intended the earth to be different after the flood.

1 peter's good news to the recipients of his message is this: You will survive one way or another. We live in difficult times. Persecution and death may come any moment, but we need not worry. You belong to God.

These chapters are helpful to those who have changed their lives. They are not running with the old crowd. They have a new way to live which does not include the old friends. 

As aI read 1 Peter and as I think of these flash sermons, I know I am only at the beginning. This form of writing and this biblical text has just started to work on me. It will take more time and study to go deeper and find where the breath of God is in it.

Amen.
