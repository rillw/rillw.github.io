  The Word became flesh, and lived among us. We saw his glory, such
  glory as of the one and only Son of the Father, full of grace and truth

  -- John 1:14 (WEB)

Recent studies have shown the unreliability of eyewitness testimony.
Yet we depend on it.

* What did you see?
* What did you hear?
* Who was there?
* What happened?
* What did he say?
* What did she do?

The New Testament witness to Jesus goes back again and again to the
testimony of eyewitnesses.

  ... that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes,
  that which we saw, and our hands touched,
  
  -- 1 John 1:1 (WEB)

Jesus is real--

* not a fantom
* not a ghost
* not an idea

Jesus is real.

Today's witness is not just that Jesus is real, but that Jesus is God
with us. That's what God's word becoming flesh means.

|  This is [God]'s doing.
|  It is marvelous in our eyes.

  -- Psalm 118:23 (WEB)
