For December 18 ...

|    O Adonai, and leader of the House of Israel, 
|    who appeared to Moses in the fire of the burning bush 
|    and gave him the law on Sinai: 
|    Come and redeem us with an outstretched arm.

Today's antiphon recalls God's mighty deeds in the Moses story.

  Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand, with an
  outstretched arm, with great terror, with signs, and with wonders (euteronomy 26:8 WEB).

The children of Israel were enslaved in Egypt. God sent Moses to free
them. Later Moses received the Ten Commandments from God on Mount
Sinai.

By remembering this story, we look to Jesus to come and save us
because we, too, have felt the heavy hand of opression, fear and
death. We long for our burdens to be lifted and to be set free.

All this longing is expressed today in this great o antiphon.
