I am gathering some of my favorite biblical quotations to be a
database for a random signature file in my email client.

I don't believe anyone has just one favorite biblical verse. It's a
case of just choosing one at any given moment to offer when asked.

One of today's readings was Psalm 27. Here are the selections I added
to my database.

::

   YHWH is my light and my salvation.
      Whom shall I fear?
   YHWH is the strength of my life.
      Of whom shall I be afraid?
   Psalm 27:1
   When you said, "Seek my face,"
      my heart said to you, "I will seek your face, YHWH."
   Psalm 27:8

   I am still confident of this:
      I will see the goodness of YHWH in the land of the living.
      Psalm 27:13
   Wait for YHWH.
         Be strong, and let your heart take courage.
   Yes, wait for YHWH.
   Psalm 27:14


I wonder what goes into making a verse a favorite verse. Today my
criteria was:

* It must be positive.
* It must give me comfort.
