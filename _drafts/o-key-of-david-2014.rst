For December 20 ...

|    O Key of David and sceptre of the House of Israel; 
|    you open and no one can shut; 
|    you shut and no one can open: 
|    Come and lead the prisoners from the prison house, 
|    those who dwell in darkness and the shadow of death.

one way of reflecting on the Great O Antiphons is to consider Isaiah's
prophetic words. Prophecy is tricky. It is quite presumptuous for me
to think that thousands of years ago someone said something that
applies directly to me and to my situation. On the other hand, if I
think, as i do, that God can speak through ancient words from another
time and situation, then prophecy makes sense. Isaiah was not
speaking to me down the centuries but rather God is using Isaiah's
words to speak to me. There's a subtle difference here.

One of the great promises of long ago is that prisoners will go free.
Thinking about this promise and the crysis of incarceration of a
disproportional number of African American men in America, today's
antiphon calls on Jesus to come and right this inequity and make
opportunity for black men who have no opportunity to live rich and
fulfilling lives. Jesus can open these doors of freedom and close the
doors of despair and disenfranchisement.
