`Nanowrimo <http://nanowrimo.org/>`_ started last Saturday. I started
out with good word counts, but by the middle of the week I was
struggling. I had four days when my word counts were:

* 524
* 815
* 0
* 557

Needless to say, I am behind.

I'm not too worried today. My spreadsheet tells me I can write a few
hundred words more than 1667 and I will still complete my novel. I
know from experience this is true. If I work steadily and have a day
or two when I can really turn on my jets and write thousands of words,
I'll finish easily.

What are some of the problems?

1. I've been struggling with voice. Who is telling the story.
2. Plot. I had some ideas, but as a pantser, I just write. I was
   fumbling to know what came next.

Now I have a better idea of the plot and some of the conflicts. If you
read `Behind Enemy Lines <../behind-enemy-lines.html>`_ you will see
the notes I am writing to myself and how I am setting up the conflicts
and the resolutions if I know them.

Today2121 words and  novel writing is fun again.
