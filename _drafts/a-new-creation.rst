2 Corinthians 5:16-6:2 is a wonderful passage--perhaps one of the most
wonderful passages in the New Testament. But because it is New Year's
Eve, I'm going to focus on verse 17.


  Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old
  things have passed away. Behold, all things have become new.

  -- 2 Corinthians 5:17 WEB

It is hard for me to think of myself as a new creation. Mostly I think
about how old I am; how my life probably won't get better from here
on.

* My body will break down.
* My mind may break down, too.
* I will become more restricted in my choices.

But here, as 2014 passes away, I have this text which says I am a new creation because of Jesus. Reconciliation with God is mine (and yours).

I must remember to remind myself that I am a new creation, that
possibilities exist, that changes are possible. It is a new year
tomorrow with new experiences and opportunities. Espite my age, I am
charged with living life as fully as i am able.
