Text: Acts 1:1-11; Matthew 13:44-52

Place `First Baptist Madison <http://firstbaptistmadison.com/>`_

In the name of Jesus. Amen.

Today is either Easter 7 in lectionary speak or Ascension Sunday. Easter
7 features Jesus' high priestly prayer in John 17 which always sounds to
me like "I am in you and you are in me and we are in Thee." By the
time I get finished reading this chapter, I feel so turned around I'm
certain I could not pin the tail on the donkey. I simply fall down. In
the past, I have tried it. It is not a good choice for me to preach.

Throughout the Easter season, the cwlectionarydictionary has proposed readings from
the book of Revelation. I did not think a city falling out of the sky
would work for me either.

You can tell by your bulletin that musically we have headed in the
direction of Ascension Sunday. I felt on safer ground there. Here is a
portion of the text that goes with the music:

    [Jesus said to the apostles] you will receive power when the Holy Spirit
    comes on you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all
    Judea and Samara, and to the ends of the earth.” After he said this, he
    was taken up before their very eyes, and a cloud hid him from their
    sight. They were looking intently up into the sky as he was going, when
    suddenly two men dressed in white stood beside them. “Men of Galilee,”
    they said, “why do you stand here looking into the sky? This same Jesus,
    who has been taken from you into heaven, will come back in the same way
    you have seen him go into heaven.” (Acts 1:8-11 NIV)

The problem for the preacher, of course, is the physics of the thing.
Heaven has to be up, on the other side of the sky. I'm never sure when I
read Acts if I am to believe a story like this literally or whether I am
just supposed to know that Jesus is with God in heaven. Besides, the
best part of this story is the blank stares of the apostles as Jesus
leaves them. They are so stupefied the two white-clothed men probably
heavenly messengers, angels, have to intervene. Is this a guy thing? Or
is it payback time? The apostles said the women who went to the tomb
Easter morning told an idle tale.

I went to The Gathering last Sunday, the fledgling early morning service
downstairs. Our theme for our conversation was treasure. We read a
number of Scriptural texts that referenced treasure:

+ For where your treasure is, there your heart will be as well. (Matthew
  6:21)
+ But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this
  all-surpassing power is from God and not from us. (2 Corinthians 4:7)

Braille Bibles are very awkward things. I can carry a volume or two, but
not the whole Bible with Me., unless I prepare ahead of time, I am never
one of the readers in such an informal gathering. With the advent of net
books, I can carry a laptop computer with me so I have the text to
review, but I cannot listen and speak at the same time. I have never
gotten the multitasking thing down. 

One of my strategies has been to recap texts. I memorize poorly. I do
not get the quotation exactly right I am usually close enough that it is
recognizable. 

Some years ago, I participated in a Lenten service in a `church <http://stlukesjamestown.org>`_  with
beautiful stained glass windows. They told the story of Jesus' life. The
service was structured around the windows and the biblical texts they
represent. We took turns reading the texts and the prayers. I, of
course, could not take a turn. After several weeks of this, I decided to
be bold. I said, “Suppose I tell the story and other people can read
the prayers." The group was amenable to this arrangement. 

Telling the biblical stories is very hard. The narrative is very closely
written. As I recapped the stories, I found myself leaving out lots of
details. I had to think carefully, for example, to focus on what Martha
said to Jesus at Lazarus's tomb or what Mary said to him that day. I
could not always fit in what the crowd had to say. I had to make sure
Jesus prayed and then called Lazarus out of the tomb. 

Last week, as we focused on treasure, a verse came to my mind. When all
the readings were done, I added my verse. I paraphrased the parable of
the man, the field, and the treasure.

The idea of treasure has been with me all week so when it came time to
pick a text for this Sunday, I went with the verse I paraphrased last
week and a few more.

What do you think of when I say treasure? 

+ I think of a treasure chest with pieces of eight, bright and shiny, spilling out of the open chest. 
+ I think of an old television movie with the Hardy boys and Mr. Apple gate and a search for a pirate's buried treasure. 
+ I think of treasure maps, Long John Silver, the Hispaniola and Treasure Island. 
+ I think of a book I had as a child called Captain Kidd's Cat. 
+ I did not see the Pirate's of the Caribbean movies, but I have been on the ride at Disney World. 

  Yes, and I say “see “a movie because “listen to'' a movie sounds
  really dumb to me.

Now, let me state the obvious here. Every child that has been coming up
front here knows that when the adult in charge asks a question like,
“What do you think of when I say treasure?" the right answer is Jesus.
At First Baptist, you can also get away with “love". The right answer
is not a treasure chest, a sunken Spanish galleon or an expedition to
the Amazon to search for El Dor do. 

Nevertheless, thinking about buried treasure helps me with my text. It
may not be on a sandy island. It may not even be in a chest. The
treasure is buried and the man finds it. Excitedly, the man who finds it
re-buries it and then buys the field so the treasure can be his. 

The same is true of the merchant though his pearl of great price is out
in the open for sale.

I have been thinking about all of Chapter 13 in Matthew's gospel.
Scholars are certain Jesus did not go on a parable marathon, tossing
these stories out like a comedian with one-liners. I remember someone
recalls that Bob Hope, known for his rapid-fire delivery, would toss
out a joke. And if the audience did not laugh, he would repeat it until
they did. 

The more I looked at this chapter, the more I realized these parables
are not all the same. Jesus starts with the sewer and his seeds. He
moves on to the wheat and the tares or weeds. These are long stories and
the disciples require explanations. Some seeds yield a great harvest,
some do not. The weeds need to be sorted out of the harvest. The kingdom
of heaven is like leaven in bread dough or a mustard seed. Then, our
verses occur.

I am willing to bet you are okay with the treasure and with the pearl of
great price, but the dragnet makes you uncomfortable. There is the
sorting out of the fish and the throwing of bad fish into the fiery
furnace. The gnashing of teeth suggests an unexpected separation. The
weeds are separated from the wheat. Some seeds do not grow. Some fish
are bad. We worry “Is it me?"

Remember. The men dressed in white who appear at the Ascension remind
the apostles that Jesus is coming back on the clouds to rule over all
creation. To rule the sovereign must make judgments. Which fish are
good? Which are bad? The Council of Nicaea in the fourth century framed
it this way: 

    [Jesus] ascended into heaven And is seated at the right hand of the Father. He will come again in
    glory to judge the living and the dead, and his kingdom will have no
    end.

However, I digress.

What fascinates me about the treasure, is this: It is found without the
need of a treasure map. The merchant funds the pearl of great price in
the marketplace.

Everything else we know about the kingdom is labor intensive:

+ sewing the seed
+ planting the wheat
+ harvesting the wheat
+ Making yeast bread
+ Dealing with the mustard seeds

I am not a farmer so I cannot comment sensibly on the sewing of the
field and the reaping of the harvest.

I make good yeast breads from scratch. My favorite recipe begins with
five pounds of flour, 3 packages of yeast and 12 ounces of honey. It
makes four large braided loaves and requires three risings. It takes all
day.

Mustard seeds stick to everything and just take over. They push up
through the cracks in the driveway.

When I think of the kingdom, I think of work:

+ getting out in the world
+ interacting with people
+ building buildings
+ raising money
+ helping people
+ Putting my life and possessions on the line for a cause.

However, here a man is out in the field, maybe worrying about the weeds,
or maybe not, and comes upon the treasure by accident.

I never imagine he is in a cultivated field. I imagine rough ground.
Perhaps a pasture. Perhaps just an undeveloped piece of land. Then,
there is the treasure. I am not sure what the man is doing to find the
treasure--a treasure that must be buried again.

The merchant I can understand. I have been garage saying and finding all
sorts of goodies. The merchant is looking over fine pearls when he spots
the special one. 

The point about the treasure is how unexpected it is. It is just there,
waiting to be found.

But here is the thing: It is not free. The man who finds the treasure
must go buy the field. The merchant sells all he has to buy the pearl.

This may strike our Protestant souls as works righteousness. 

+ What about grace? 
+ What about God's love?
+ What about “Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done? 
+ What is this buying of the field, buying the pearl of great price? 
+ What is the good news here?

Purchasing the field, purchasing the pearl is not what these parables
are about. 

+ They are about a decisive response to Jesus. 
+ They are about recognizing the treasure who is Jesus. 
+ They are about the joy and excitement of knowing Jesus. 
+ They are about making Jesus the guiding rule of our lives.

We sang

    | Crown Jesus the Lord of Life.
    | Crown Jesus the Lord of Peace.
    | Crown Jesus the Lord of Love.

We hold this treasure in clay jars, that is, the treasure we dare to
hold in our fragile bodies and tender spirits. 

But what a treasure it is. It is so fabulous the man rushes off joyfully
to buy a field before someone else can discover the hidden treasure. 

The merchant liquidates all his assets to possess the finest pearl he
has ever seen. 

Would you do this? Do you do this for Jesus' rule in your own life?

Through these parables, Jesus teaches us to be discerning. The merchant
certainly needs to know about pearls to spot the best one. Our field
walker needs to know what he is seeing and to exhibit the curiosity to
investigate something that should not be there in the field. 

+ They need to be resourceful, coming up with the wherewithal to purchase field and pearl quickly.
+ They need to be risk takers. Suppose someone had already discovered thetreasure in the field for themselves and stolen it.
+ What if the pearl turns out to be a fake.
+ They need to act quickly.
+ Each of these opportunities is one of a kind.

There is something intangible here, too. I will call it the desire to
treasure the treasure. They do not possess their treasure as an
investment for future negotiations. It is not buying art, for example,
as an investment. It is buying the art because it is purely beautiful.

Throughout the New Testament, we are advised again and again to “be
ready''. We are reminded many times that we do not know the hour or the
day when Jesus will return. We do not need bodies floating upward in the
sky or cities falling down out of the clouds to heed this warning. We
can ready about a man walking through a field or a merchant browsing the
displays at the store to know we must be vigilant and ready when Jesus
calls us.

At the very core of these parables is the sheer joy and beauty of these
treasures. The saying is true: Where your treasure is, so is your heart.
Our hearts are with Jesus and with Jesus' love, Jesus' rule, and Jesus'
saving power in our lives.

When we find the treasure, when we know Jesus, We have come into the
kingdom, into Jesus' rule. Our whole outlook on life changes. Our
priorities shift. We are free. 

Be certain of this: You have found the treasure. It is yours. The thing
about this treasure is, other people can find it, too, when they find
it, their finding of the treasure does not diminish your treasure in any
way. In fact, their finding of the treasure increases our enjoyment of
our treasure. When you find Jesus, you find the treasure. It is fairer,
brighter and purer than any pirate's treasure ever buried. Amen.
