In 2003, poets joined together to protest the Second Gulf War. I submitted this poem to `Poets Against the War <http://poetsagainstthewar.org>`_. The archive is no longer extent.

| Send me a poem.
| Make it wonderful.
| Make it beautiful.
| Make it sing and shout and cry out loud.
| Make it speak with two voices, each augmenting the words of the other.
|
| How can a poem against the war be wonderful--unless it 
| stops the war?
| How can a poem against the war be beautiful--unless its beauty
| creates wholeness and safety, replacing isolation and fear?
| How can a poem against the war sing and shout and cry aloud--unless it
| sings protests,
| shouts NO in boldface,
| cries out loud for
| the dead,
| the wounded,
| the disabled,
| the mad,
| the orphaned,
| the widowed,
| the childless,
| the friendless?
| How can a poem against the war speak with two voices--unless it
| speaks with more than 5,000 poet voices augmenting each other against the war?
| 
| Send us such a poem ... now!
