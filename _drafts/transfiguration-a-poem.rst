| From the light of the star the wise ones followed
| to the brilliance of Transfiguration--
|  From Jordan's depths, baptismal waters flowing,
| to soaring peak of Hermon, divine cloud hovering--
|  From Advent's darkness, Christ's light overcoming,
| to Transfiguration's clarity, God's chosen shining--
|  From Galilee to Jerusalem, Christ's face set like flint,
| Jesus' exodus beginning, the way of the cross Christ's glory.
|  Transfigured before you today, Christ's sovereignty brightly showing.
| "Listen to my Child, my chosen. this one alone is holy."
