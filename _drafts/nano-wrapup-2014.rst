I finished the novel on Thanksgiving morning. This was amazing since I
caught a stomach bug from my granddaughter. 

You can read the entire `novel <../behind-enemy-lines.html>`_, notes,
warts and all.

I had a few days of panic when I was feeling overwhelmed and very
uncertain what to do. All my uncertainties are in the notes. As usual,
I just needed to keep writing and it sorted itself out.

Surprises:

1. I killed off Christabel. I think more will be said about that in a
   later novel.

2. I could not hear Ronnie's voice at the beginning, but as the novel
   progressed, this became her story and if I write a second draft, it
   will clearly be her story. Star Runner's narration will come later
   and fill in some blanks.

3. I did not know how bad the bad guys are.

There are still lots of holes. Novel writing is different than life. A
reader expects the ambiguities to be resolved.

I am pleased with the attempt and delighted I got the job done yet again.
