| A wintry taste of splattered rain against my nose.
| A skittering pebble crosses our path ahead.
| An ocean roar of traffic ebbs away
| All sense of place and time so that alone
| We circumnavigate an empty world.
| In windy solitude we travel sure
| Through colorless environs gray and white and dull
| Until we reach that holy spot and shut
| The door to hold that lonely world at bay,
| And find the warmth and color we had lacked.
| When walking round the autumn world outdoors.
