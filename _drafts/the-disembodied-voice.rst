I walk with my Seeing Eye dog to the Middleton Senior Center every
weekday for lunch and a variety of activities. Any route we take, we
come to the four-way stop at Elmwood and Parmenter.

On a crisp autumnal Monday, we waited patiently at the corner for
traffic to clear.

"Good dog," a man said.

"Yes he is," I replied to this stranger.

The traffic stopped in front of us.

"Let's go," the man said.

My dog and I crossed the street, turned right and continued on our way.

No matter what time of day I came to this four-way stop during the rest
of the week, the man and I exchanged these same sentences. Our exchanges
reminded me of the homeless man who frequented the intersection near
where I used to live.

"A dog is man's best friend," he said every time he passed me on the
street.

I always agreed with him. He rarely said anything else.

One day when I was walking with my white cane, he said to me, "Where's
your dog?"

"She died," I told him.

To my astonishment, he stopped walking past me and said, "That's a real
shame."

The following Monday, no cheerful greeting met us. There was silence on
Tuesday and Wednesday as well.

On Thursday, I walked into Bloom Bake Shop to order half a dozen
chocolate vegan cupcakes for the coming weekend.

"What happened to the man who was at the corner last week?" I asked.

"What man?" the woman serving me asked.

"The man who talked to me every day last week," I said. "He was so
pleasant."

"Is that who you were talking to?"

"Sure. I talk to everybody who speaks to me, especially if they
compliment my dog."

"I never saw anybody. I thought you were on your cell phone."

"Are you sure?" I asked. I felt foolish as soon as I spoke.

There was an awkward silence. I started to get a bad feeling. Was she
saying she thought I talked to myself or imagined people who weren't
there?

Your cupcakes will be ready tomorrow at noon."

Her tone was not as friendly as it had been when I was ordering my
cupcakes.

We left the shop and turned the corner to walk home. I reviewed our
conversation. I did hear a voice speaking to me. I answered. The woman
in the bake shop saw no one. She heard me answer. No wonder she was
cautious in the way she treated me.

In retrospect, my friend wasn't like the homeless man. He never walked
past me. He never stood next to me. He was a disembodied voice. I did
not imagine our conversations. I am certain of this.

"Good dog," he said. And I replied, "yes he is," "Let's go," he said. My
assumption was that he was saying it was safe to cross the street, but
was that what he meant?

A memory of a farmer came to me then, standing next to his truck outside
the vet's office, crying.

"She was a good dog," he said. "We brought home many a bird. She was old
and deaf. She liked sleeping under the truck. I told the kids to be
careful--not to run over her. She didn't hear the engine start anymore.
It was me who wasn't careful. It was me who didn't look."

Then I knew why I could hear the disembodied voice. I believe a dog is a
good and precious companion. Wherever or whenever the man lived, he
believed it, too.
