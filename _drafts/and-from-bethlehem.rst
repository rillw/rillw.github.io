  Many of the multitude therefore, when they heard these words, said,
  "This is truly the prophet." Others said, "This is the Christ." But
  some said, "What, does the Christ come out of Galilee? Hasn't the
  Scripture said that the Christ comes of the seed of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?" 

  -- John 7:40-22 (WEB)

Unsurprisingly, Jesus is in the middle of a controversy. We can get
the gist of the immediate controversy by reading the entire passage
suggested for today's reading from the Book of Common Prayer--John
7:37-52.

+ The Gospel According to Mark is silent about where Jesus was born.
+ Matthew says Jesus was living in Bethlehem when the wise men
  visited and later moved to Nazareth for political reasons and to
  fulfill Scripture.
+ Luke explains Joseph and Mary traveled to Bethlehem from
  Nazareth because of a worldwide census.

The Gospel of John knows nothing about a Bethlehem connection. More
important, not having a Bethlehem connection and being from Galilee is
a problem.

It boils down to a Scripture war. Whose proof text is better? The
Pharisees have Micah 5:2:

|    But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah,
|    being small among the clans of Judah,
|    out of you one will come forth to me that is to be ruler in Israel;
|    whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.

They chide Nicodemus "Are you also from Galilee? Search, and
see that no prophet has arisen out of Galilee." (John 7:52 WEB)

Here's an answering verse:

  But there shall be no more gloom for her who was in anguish. In the
  former time, he brought into contempt the land of Zebulun and the
  land of Naphtali; but in the latter time he has made it glorious, by
  the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.

  -- Isaiah 9:1 (WEB)

This is the passage which goes on to speak of the "people who have
walked in darkness and the shadow of death have seen a great light"
(v. 2).

This passage goes on to say:

  His name will be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God,
  Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

  -- (Isaiah 9:5b WEB)

I don't think it gets better than this.
