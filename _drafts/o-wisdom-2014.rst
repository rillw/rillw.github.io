Advent anticcipation is heightened by the use of the Great O
Antiphons. These are prayers all beginning with the interjection *O*
and pleading with Jesus, by invoking his messianic titles, to come and
do something as we sink deeper into the darkness of despair, sin and
death which precede the true glory of Christmas.

For December 17 ...

    | O Wisdom, coming forth from the mouth of the Most High, 
    |  reaching from one end to the other, 
    |  mightily and sweetly ordering all things: 
    |  Come and teach us the way of prudence. 

Today we focus on the messianic title Wisdom and we pray for Jesus to
come  and teach us prudence. The focus here is on the mighty ordering
of all Creation and the desire for prudent living.

I often think of order as restrictive or binding:

* neat rows
* a place for everything and everything in its place
* expending energy to tidy up rather than creating something.

I'm basically a messy person and I live in a constant state of
disorder.

I have this dream though: I will have a zen-like existance with few
objects and open spaces. I will ive in an airy place with only
necessities and lots of sunshine. It never happens.

The longing here is for chaos and randomness to be kept at bay, for
there to be predictability and fairness. In short, for the world to
make sense. And so often, the world makes no sense at all. We live by
chance rather than design.

Our spiritual teachers have an anecdote: prudence.

Like order, prudence is not a virtue I aspire to. It sounds very
prosaic and colorless. I want financial people to be prudent and those
operating heavy machinery or driving vehicles to be prudent. I want to
be flamboyant and imaginative.

Whether our world is sweetly ordered today or in tatters, the way
of prudence we pray to learn today will give us good judgment to live
lives worthy of our calling.  Our intentional acts will shine out into Advent darkness as
a beacon to all those who are still in termoil and seeking a way
forward into the light of Christmas grace.

Today we pray that Jesus, our Wisdom, will teach us that way forward.
